# Project Description

This code is a Python script that uses the web2py framework to create a RESTful API that interacts with a MongoDB database. The API has two endpoints: `catalog` and `service_instances`. The `catalog` endpoint returns a list of items in the database, while the `service_instances` endpoint creates and deletes MongoDB instances.

# Dependencies

This code requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- web2py
- PyYAML
- Docker SDK for Python

# How to Install Dependencies

To install the dependencies, you can use pip, the Python package manager. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install web2py PyYAML docker
```

# How to Execute the Code

To execute the code, you need to run the web2py server. Navigate to the directory where the code is located and run the following command:

```
python web2py.py
```

This will start the web2py server on your local machine. You can then access the API by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
