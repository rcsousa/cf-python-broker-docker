# Web2py Framework Application

This is a sample Web2py Framework application. The code is released under public domain and you can use it without limitations.

## Description

This application is a basic Web2py Framework application that can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications. It includes a main menu with a "Home" option and a development menu with useful links to internal and external resources.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python and Web2py Framework installed on your machine. You can download Web2py Framework from the official website: http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download.

Once you have installed Web2py Framework, you can clone this repository or download the code as a ZIP file and extract it to the "applications" folder in your Web2py installation directory.

## Execution

To run the application, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the Web2py installation directory, and run the following command:

```
python web2py.py -a your_password -i 127.0.0.1 -p 8000
```

Replace "your_password" with a password of your choice. This will start the Web2py server on your local machine and you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/your_app_name (replace "your_app_name" with the name of the application folder).
